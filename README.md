# SCI2FB
Converts Sierra SCI game patch resource files for the Yamaha FB-01/IMFC into 2 sysex bank files that the FB-01 understands directly (with software). This is useful for backing up and creating a library of Sierra FB-01 instrument banks and also for capturing FB-01 instrument voices from Sierra games to utilize in creating custom banks for SCI fangames (or even other Sierra games).

Usage:
sci2fb  patfile  bankfile1  bankfile2
